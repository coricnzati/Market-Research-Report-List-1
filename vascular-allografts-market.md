<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vascular Allografts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cortical Allograft</li><li>Cancellous Allograft</li><li>Corticocancellous Allograft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vascular allografts market is categorized into three main types: cortical allografts, cancellous allografts, and corticocancellous allografts. Cortical allografts are dense bone grafts sourced from the outer layer of bone, providing structural support. Cancellous allografts are spongy bone grafts that offer excellent cell proliferation and osteoconductivity, making them ideal for filling voids. Corticocancellous allografts combine both types, providing the benefits of both density and porosity, thereby enhancing healing and integration in various surgical applications.</p></p>
