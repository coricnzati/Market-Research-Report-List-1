<p><p>Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) treatment primarily involves the use of medications to manage symptoms and slow disease progression. The first-line treatment is typically ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), which aids in bile flow and improves liver function. In cases where patients do not respond adequately to UDCA, other therapies such as obeticholic acid may be utilized. Additionally, management of symptoms and complications is vital, involving the use of immunosuppressants, liver transplants, and lifestyle modifications.</p><p>The Primary Biliary Cholangitis Treatment Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.4% during the forecast period. This growth is attributed to the increasing prevalence of PBC, heightened awareness of the disease, and advancements in treatment options. Furthermore, ongoing research aimed at developing novel therapeutics and combination therapies is likely to drive market expansion. Collaborations between pharmaceutical companies and research institutions are fostering innovation in treatment modalities. The rise in diagnostic technologies and a better understanding of disease mechanisms are also contributing to market progress. As the healthcare landscape evolves, patient-centric approaches and personalized medicine are expected to play significant roles in shaping the future of PBC treatment.</p></p>
